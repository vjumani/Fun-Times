# Fun-Times
Some fun for all

# Assumptions:
There is a limitless stock count, or either the validation for the stock in the basket provided has already been completed before calculations are being computed.
There is no DB, so all data is currently converted into enum models.
The same items can be added multiple times into the cart
The StockItem and Discount enum are already linked to each other via the enum instead of associating them manually in the code.
